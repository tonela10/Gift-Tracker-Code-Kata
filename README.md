### Overview 
This repository contains a collaborative Christmas-themed **Android Code Kata** designed to practice modern UI development with **Jetpack Compose**.  
It’s meant to be done with teammates, focusing on building **adaptive layouts** for mobile and tablet, adding small **animations**, and exploring the new **Navigation 3** APIs — especially the use of **pane-based navigation** for multi-window experiences.

Perfect for a short team session to experiment, learn, and have fun while creating a simple but responsive **Gift Tracker** app.
